# Lung-Cancer-Prediction
This project aims to predict the presence of lung cancer based on certain features such as age, smoking, Level and lung function test results. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed to gain insights into the dataset and identify any patterns or trends. The dataset was then split into training and testing sets and Logistic Regression model and other Machine Learning model were trained and tested on the data. The feature importance was also analyzed, and it was found that smoking history, Level and lung function tests were the most important predictors of lung cancer. The results of this project suggest that machine learning models can be useful in predicting the presence of lung cancer based on certain patient characteristics.
